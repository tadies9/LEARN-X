# Onboarding Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Onboarding Redirect Issue
- **Problem**: Users were not being redirected to onboarding after signup
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated registration flow to include `?next=/onboarding` in email redirect
  - Added middleware checks to redirect users without personas to onboarding
  - Updated auth callback to check onboarding status

### 2. Sidebar During Onboarding
- **Problem**: Sidebar was showing during onboarding process
- **Solution**: Added `/onboarding` to the routes that don't show sidebar in AppLayout

### 3. Poor Contrast on White Backgrounds
- **Problem**: Onboarding components had poor visibility on light theme
- **Solution**: 
  - Created OnboardingCard component with proper borders and shadows
  - Added blue tinted background matching AuthCard style
  - Made all cards white inside with proper contrast

### 4. Student-Focused Updates
- **Problem**: Onboarding was too professional-oriented
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed "Industry" to "Aspired Industry"
  - Removed "Years of Experience" and "Technical Level" fields
  - Added "Field of Study" field
  - Updated all text to be student-appropriate

### 5. UI/UX Improvements
- **Problem**: Onboarding UI needed polish
- **Solution**: 
  - Added icons to all step headers
  - Improved typography and spacing
  - Redesigned Interests step with tabbed interface
  - Added ability to input custom interests and topics
  - Made learning style cards centered with 2-column layout
  - Reduced card sizes for better mobile experience

### 6. Backend Compatibility Issue
- **Problem**: Backend was rejecting the new `academicCareer` field
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated backend validation to accept both `academicCareer` and `professional` fields
  - Fixed middleware to use correct table name (`personas` instead of `user_personas`)
  - Ensured backward compatibility with existing data
