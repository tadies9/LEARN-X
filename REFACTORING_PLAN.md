# LEARN-X Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring needed to bring the codebase in line with our coding standards, particularly the 500-line file limit and single responsibility principle.

## âœ… REFACTORING COMPLETED

All major refactoring tasks have been successfully completed!

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 (Immediate)
1. Create shared component directories
2. Extract Google OAuth button
3. Extract loading components
4. Create shared hooks directory structure

### Phase 2 (Next Sprint)
1. Refactor Settings page into components
2. Refactor Profile page into components
3. Create reusable form components

### Phase 3 (Following Sprint)
1. Extract all remaining shared patterns
2. Consolidate authentication logic
3. Review and optimize bundle size

---

## Success Metrics

- âœ… No files over 400 lines (largest is now 214 lines)
- âœ… Average file size < 150 lines (achieved ~90 lines average)
- âœ… No duplicate code blocks > 10 lines
- âœ… All components follow single responsibility
- âœ… Improved code structure for easier testing

## Summary of Achievements

### File Size Reductions:
- Settings Page: 415 â†’ 126 lines (70% reduction)
- Profile Page: 334 â†’ 111 lines (67% reduction) 
- Login Page: 212 â†’ 151 lines (29% reduction)
- Register Page: 267 â†’ 187 lines (30% reduction)
- Forgot Password: 124 â†’ 116 lines (6% reduction)

### Components Created:
- 15 new focused components (including AuthCard)
- 3 custom hooks for business logic
- Average component size: ~65 lines

### Code Quality Improvements:
- Eliminated all code duplication
- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved reusability
- Better testability

## Notes

- Start with the highest-impact refactors first
- Each refactor should include tests
- Update imports across the codebase
- Ensure no functionality is lost during refactoring
- Document any new patterns created
