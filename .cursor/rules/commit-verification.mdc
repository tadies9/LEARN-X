# Commit Verification Rule

## Always Verify Before Commit

**CRITICAL**: Never use `--no-verify` or `--skip-hooks` when committing unless the user explicitly requests it.

### Required Process:
1. **Always run standard git commit** without bypass flags
2. **Let pre-commit hooks execute** (type checking, linting, etc.)
3. **Fix any errors** that the hooks identify before proceeding
4. **Only bypass verification** if user explicitly says "commit without verify" or similar

### Examples of When NOT to Bypass:
- TypeScript errors in codebase
- Linting failures
- Test failures
- Build errors
- Any pre-commit hook failures

### Only Bypass When User Says:
- "commit without verification"
- "skip pre-commit hooks"
- "commit with --no-verify"
- "bypass verification this time"

### Error Handling:
- If commit fails due to hooks, **fix the errors first**
- Don't automatically retry with `--no-verify`
- Inform user about the specific errors found
- Ask user if they want to fix errors or bypass verification

This ensures code quality and prevents introducing broken code to the repository.
