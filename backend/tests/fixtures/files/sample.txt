## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### Key Concepts

1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled training data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in data without labels
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction with environment

### Applications

Machine learning is used in:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis

### Conclusion

Machine learning continues to evolve and transform various industries through automation and intelligent decision-making.
